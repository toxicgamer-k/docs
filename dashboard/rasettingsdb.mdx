RA Requests, also called Reduced Activity Requests, are a form of Leave of Absence where the staff member isn't required to complete the full quota, but expects that they will be able to complete it partially.&#x20;

## RA Role

This role will be assigned to staff members when they are on RA and will be automatically removed once they are off RA, ensuring that their status is accurately reflected at all times.
