## Punishments Channel

This is the channel where all ROBLOX punishments (such as warn, kick, ban, BOLO, etc.) will be logged by default. However, you have the option to configure specific punishments to be logged in designated channels, as outlined below.

## Custom Logging Channels
Here you're able to set seperate channels for kicks, bans, and BOLOs to be logged in. For example, you can set it so that all kicks logged will go in the "**kick-logs**" channel.
