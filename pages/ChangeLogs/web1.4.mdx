We've been quiet for the past month making new, revolutionary features that will empower your community! I am overjoyed to show this release to the public.

## LOA Management

> You can now manage and request LOAs on the ERM Website.

### **To Manage LOAs:**

Go to the **Dashboard** -> **Manage LOAs**

> You can view previous, active, and pending LOAs! This also allows you to a concise list of a users LOA history by simply going to the \*\*Review LOAs\*\* tab and clicking on "History" on pending LOAs.

* On the \*\*Shift Leaderboard\*\* on the dashboard, it now indicates if a user is on LOA. You can click on the indicator, and it will lead you to the LOA page and open a popup of that LOAs details.

> This also allows you to \*\*Sort\*\* LOAs. On every tab, there is a select menu for sorting by E**xpiry Date**, **Creation Date**, **Username**, **Status**, and R**eason**.

### To Request an LOA:

Go to the **Mod Panel** -> **Quick Action**-> **Manage LOA**

> You can request for an LOA and view your LOA history!&#x20;

* If you have a pending or active LOA, it will tell you and show you information about it!



## Site Rewrite

We are excited to announce that we have just finished a **complete site rewrite** in order to accommodate the latest releases in the underlying technology that we use.

### **What does this mean for me?**

* More intuitive UI

* Quicker Loading Times

* Much more!



## New Landing Page

Let's face it, the site needed a fresh coat of paint. I've remade the home page to be more modern & eye catching for new guests! It now shows our entire feature suite instead of only showing a few features.

## Theme Library

We've now release a theme library so you can publish and use themes made by the community! The support and QA team have already made a few themes for you to try out.&#x20;

### **For Publishers**

> Go to **Theme Marketplace** -> **Create Theme**

> You can customize the name, description, tags, and colors! To view your theme in real time, there will be a **Live Preview** section to the right of the page.

* To edit existing themes, go to **Theme Marketplace** -> **My Themes** -> Hover over a Theme -> **Edit**

* To delete existing themes, go to **Theme Marketplace** -> **My Themes** -> Hover over a Theme -> **Delete**

### **For Non-Publishers**

> Go to **Theme Marketplace** -> Click on any theme that interests you

* You can apply any theme you want and have it work locally on your machine. This overwrites any existing theme you had enabled.

* You can rate themes by clicking on the stars to the right of the screen.
