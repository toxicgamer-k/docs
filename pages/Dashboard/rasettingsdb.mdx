RA Requests, also called Reduced Activity Requests, are a form of Leave of Absence where the staff member isn't required to complete the full quota, but expects that they will be able to complete it partially.

## RA Role

This is the role that will be given to the staff member when their RA is accepted. The role will also be removed when the RA ends.
